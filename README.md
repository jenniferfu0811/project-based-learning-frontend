# Project Based Learning - Frontend

Frontend development is challenging to learn. What helped me a lot was not only to learn theory, but to program something every day. If you are a beginner or already working as a frontend developer or designer you can benefit from this list.

### Support this Project
If this list helps you, I'd be happy if you'd support me. You can buy stickers or support me directly via buy me a coffee. This enables me to extend this list, keep this list up to date and to do many more such projects.

You can do this via [Buy me a Coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/binconsole)

Thank you.
